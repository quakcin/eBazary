## ðŸŽ“ Project
University project - mobile application for an online shopping service. 
Actually we had to make fully working backend for this, which is also included in this repo.
Application was written in react-native framework. Backed was made in php. 

## ðŸ“± Application
Supports 3 primary navigation modes. Works with backend server - source code in ./webServer - 
original server is most likely down. Uses GPS, maps and camera.
